# Publisher Media Kit for Newspack

## Overview

Publisher Media Kit provides a quick and easy option for small to medium sized publishers to digitize their media kit.  If you are a publisher hoping for a page like the [NY Times' Advertising](https://advertising.nytimes.com/), but do not have a designer or developer on staff?  Then this plugin is for you.  If you are still using a print or PDF version of your media kit to sell space on your website, but want show advertisers looking to buy digital real estate that you are a digital-forward partner?  Then this plugin is for you.

The plugin adds a new "Media Kit" page, block patterns, and placeholder content that can then be customized to fit your need (e.g., text, links, colors, images, adding page link to site footer).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I accidentally deleted a block from my `Media Kit` page, how do I add it back?

Click the block inserter (`+` button) in the top left of the block editor, click the `Patterns` tab, select `Publisher Media Kit` in the dropdown, and select the specific Block Pattern that you want to add back to your page.

### I want to add block from my `Media Kit` page on a different post/page, how do I add it outside the `Media Kit` page?

Click the block inserter (`+` button) in the top left of the block editor, click the `Patterns` tab, select `Publisher Media Kit` in the dropdown, and select the specific Block Pattern that you want to add to your post/page.

### If I rename the page title (e.g. to 'Advertising') and then deactivate and subsequently reactivate the plugin, would the plugin generate a new 'Media Kit' page?

The plugin specifically checks for the page slug `media-kit`, meaning that even if you modify the page name, the plugin will not generate a new page unless the page slug is altered or the page is moved to the trash.
